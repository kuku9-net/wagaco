The movie "Kin-dza-dza!" tells the story of a man who inadvertently warps to a weird planet and, bewildered by the differences in values and customs, attempts to return to Earth.

The warp destination was the **planet Pluke** in the "Kin-dza-dza" galaxy.
There, rank is determined by the color of the stetson, and the great ones behave arrogantly.
Those of lower status must greet the "Ku" with strange poses.
Furthermore, Patsaks are ranked lower than Chatlanians, and the protagonists who are judged as Patsaks must wear bells under their noses.
People on this planet have no altruism (especially Chatlanians) and do not hesitate to discard unnecessary people
(They will say flatly that they have thrown the useless person out of their spaceships).  
They work on rationality alone.
That rationality is also based on the goal of "wearing the stakes of a higher class".
When they learn that there is no mark of status on earth, they dismiss them as "savages," and they also say that they don't know what to aim for in life where there is no distinction between upper and lower status.
It seems that they don't know what is valuable unless society decides what it is.

People on this planet have no self with unreasonable values, and they may feel as if they are living according to a program installed by society.
But that is because we are looking at it from the outside.
Even if the values are objectively silly, if you live in a society where that is the norm, you will accept them and live with them.
It is difficult to look at a society objectively from the inside, questioning the norms of that society.
What we consider to be our own decisions are in fact only in accordance with the values instilled in us by society, and are not always **voluntary** acts.

The protagonist is repeatedly betrayed by the people of the planet Pluke, but when they are in trouble, he takes the risk himself to save their lives.
There is a scene in which the Chatlanians do not understand his altruistic behavior until the end and ask him what his purpose is.
Whether we humans on Earth can act as honorably as the protagonist, we can understand the psychology of wanting to help them.
Is this altruistic behavior of Earth merely following the values instilled in them by earth society?
Is it not a **voluntary** act?
I contend that he made a **voluntary** decision to help.
I believe that **voluntary** came from the wisdom of mankind.
The socially accepted belief that "helping others is great" is a strong truth connected to our history.
It is what has allowed us to survive on a weird planet by taking it over, maintaining self-preservation, and acting irrationally beyond profit and loss.
It is not the same as sympathy for the unreasonable conventions that lie in the empty **Lying society**.

The planet Pluke is full of deserts, but it is so advanced in civilization that individuals can have their own spaceships.
It used to have oceans, and it seems to be a planet at the end of a civilization that has gone too far.
They are so preoccupied with the race for stetes that it seems inevitable that without altruistic feelings, they will not move toward stopping the destruction of the environment.
Their rationalistic expressions are hard, and their smiles are meant to humor the great ones.
In such a world, there is only one woman with an expressive face.
She puts a mysterious tool in her mouth and dances around with it, making boo-boos, and then says,

> "Truth is meaningless on this planet."

Having voluntary emotions, she seems to be well aware that Planet Pluke is a **society of lies** dominated by trivial social conventions.


## Values of Planet Earth
Again, an excerpt from Fromm's "Escape from Freedom":

> All our energy is spent for the purpose of getting what we want,
and most people never question the premise of this activity:
that they know their true wants.
They do not stop to think whether the aims they are pursuing are something they themselves want.
In school they want to have good marks,
as adults they want to be more and more successful,
to make more money, to have more prestige, to buy a better car,
to go places, and so on.
<cite>"Escape from Freedom" Chapter 7 Freedom and Democracy</cite>

> This situation is still more emphasized by the methods of modem advertising.
The sales talk of the old-fashioned businessman was essentially rational.
He knew his merchandise, he knew the needs of the customer,
and on the basis of this knowledge he tried to sell.
To be sure, his sales talk was not entirely objective and he used persuasion
as much as he could; yet, in order to be efficient, 
it had to be a rather rational and sensible kind of talk.
A vast sector of modem advertising is different;
it does not appeal to reason but to emotion;
like any other kind of hypnoid suggestion,
it tries to impress its objects emotionally
and then make them submit intellectually.
This type of advertising impresses the customer by all sorts of means:
by repetition of the same formula again and again;
by the influence of an authoritative image,
like that of a society lady or of a famous boxer,
who smokes a certain brand of cigarette;
by attracting the customer and at the same time weakening his critical abilities by the sex appeal of a pretty girl;
by terrorizing him with the threat of "b.o." or "halitosis";
or yet again by stimulating daydreams about a sudden change in one's whole course of life brought about by buying a certain shirt or soap.
All these methods are essentially irrational;
they have nothing to do with the qualities of the merchandise,
and they smother and kill the critical capacities of the customer like an opiate or outright hypnosis.
<cite>"Escape from Freedom" Chapter 4 The Two Aspects of Freedom for Modern Man</cite>



From the point of view of the people of Planet Pluke, the people of Earth must feel that they have incomprehensible values. The modern society is dominated by these artificial values, and the stimulation of self-aggrandizement and insecurity continues to increase. The current society, where consumption is fueled by products and services that meet these needs, has been criticized as a "consumer society". While the competition to satisfy the artificial desires is powering the economy, it is also creating vulnerable people in need of basic necessities and destroying the environment.

Looking at the second quote, what is meant by the word "rational" as used here? Normally, one would consider it "rational" to maximize one's gain by conforming to/being made to conform to social standards, and one would consider it "irrational" to go to the trouble of dealing with complicated individual differences. What is rational depends on the values of the society of the time. The current term "rationality" implicitly refers to economic rationality, which is out of step with "essential rationality". We can see how market-driven values have penetrated our innermost being
<span class="footnote">
The ambiguity of the word "rationality" was pointed out by the sociologist Max Weber, and Fromm's choice of words here seems to have been made with this in mind.
</span>.

The popularization of television has contributed greatly to the formation of a consumer society. The mass media understand the demands of the masses through ratings and strive to provide what everyone wants. As a result, the mass media and the public have become mirror images. The triviality of news coverage is a barometer of the public's loss of self.  
Entertainment news is a typical example of responding to those who desire subservience. By reporting on the personal lives of celebrities, it responds to the demand for a sense of togetherness by making up for the emptiness in one's own life with the lives of others, rejoicing with others when something good happens, and criticizing others when something scandalous happens.

Whenever Sota Fujii<span class="footnote">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C5%8Dta_Fujii</span> plays a game, the day's news reports not only the easy-to-understand numbers of how old he is, how many wins, and how many championships he has won, but also what he ate during the game. That may be correct information, but it is too far removed from the essential aspects of Sota Fujii, and in that sense, it is false reporting.
The correct way to maximize viewership is to read the overall direction in which the program is headed and pander to that direction.
As a result, the meal in the game is aired as information that should be shared by the public in a limited amount of time, because it is a common part of the public and Sota Fujii, and is consumed as content for everyone's sense of togetherness.  
Even if you're trying to report something a little more meaningful, it's hard to find content that's more affordable and gets more numbers than a meal during a game.
When lies become the standard, there are forces that try to pull us back to the lie even as we try to move toward the **real** one. This can take the form of peer pressure, economic rationality, etc.

## Lying shopping
When you enter the store, you will be greeted with a smile and a welcome.
Customers feel fulfilled when they confirm their careful treatment as masters.
In the unlikely event that there is an unfriendly clerk, they are a disturber of order and an enemy of the public.
We must impose them.
We have to punish them, so we do so by complaining to the person responsible or by posting on the Internet.
They then realize that they are on the side of order and take comfort in that sense of subservience. To conclude his position as master, they turn the luxury of sweets supervised by the chefs he often sees on TV into an energy for tomorrow's obedience to thier customers. In this way, they aim for a higher level of subservience.

When you shop online, you don't even have to deal with a person. With just one click, someone delivers a product made somewhere in the world. The materials to make that product are also gathered from somewhere in the world.
How aware can we be of the people who form this vast network?
How much altruism is there?
How different are they from the people of Planet Pluke (who have no altruism and have no hesitation in cutting down unwanted people)?

Lack of ethics of caring for others induces working under harsh conditions, illegal resource exploitation, and disregard for safety.
The global economy serves as a cover for such injustices.
If your try to do business ethically, you compete at a handicap.
In other words, the key to winning the competition is to be able to conduct unethical business on the edge of not being discovered by utilizing a cover.
Every time a commodity purchased in our daily lives is distributed, the capitalist's wealth is accumulated as the injustice plugged into the nodes of a vast and complex supply chain is converted into cash.
Each one may be a tiny injustice, but aggregated by the vast global economy, the result is violence that no individual can possibly resist.
By making injustice invisible, you can make rational purchases without tainting your own sense of ethics.
Even if a wrongdoing is discovered, it can be dismissed as the work of a few bad people in a huge system and one can continue to think of oneself as a good citizen.
Documentary films about the dire situation under the cloak of the global economy are often shown in mini-theaters like the Cinematheque.<span class="footnote">

## Lying Job
{{< reference

title="The Mystery of the Bullshit Jobs - Why are there more jobs that don't fucking matter?"
year="2021"

author="Takashi Sakai"

caption="A commentary book by the Japanese translator of David Graeber's book \"Bullshit jobs\""
>}}

Cultural anthropologist David Graeber's book "Bullshit jobs," published in 2018, was a huge hit around the world, and the term **bullshit job** (**BSJ**) is often heard in Japan.
In English-speaking countries, the word "shit" is often heard, but bullshit is a much stronger and less well-behaved word. According to translator Takashi Sakai, bullshit is a word with a strong nuance of "deception" in addition to meaning "unnecessary". Graeber's definition of BSJ is as follows:

> a bullshit job is a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though, as part of the conditions of employment, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case.

It may be hard to imagine such a job for an essential worker, but Graeber's book collects a variety of BSJ testimonials, including putting in international travel for pointless meetings.
Moreover, those who do BSJ are paid better.
Even if essential workers increase their workload by reducing their living expenses or improve their work with ingenuity in an attempt to increase their income, they will not be able to reach BSJ's income.

I was also surprised to see serious BSJ workers in my first year in the IT industry (BSJ was not a word back then...).
Shortly after I was assigned to a project at the end of the project, I was given the task of writing a modification form for a program that had already been modified. Normally, from this form, I would check the intent and scope of impact of the modification before reflecting it in the code, but the creation of the document, which was only necessary for the sake of formality, was put on the back burner.
I made it up as I went along and the PMO pointed out that there were inconsistencies between the two documents.<span class="footnote">
Abbreviation for Project Management Officer.
For large projects, a team is organized to manage the project.
</span>
It is not a contradiction that is immediately obvious, but one that you have to read the contents properly and reconstruct and think about in your mind to notice.
The PMO people are a bunch of socially competent people from famous universities who actually have quick minds, and I marveled at their mental capacity to use their advanced abilities for such nonsense.
The project had dozens of members gathered on one floor of a building.
Each team was bragging to each other about working overtime and pulling all-nighters, and of course the PMO was leading the charge.  
The members of this project tended to become less knowledgeable about programming as their position became more senior. On the other hand, they have the mentality to faithfully complete not only the consistency inconsistencies in the documentation, but also to point out typos, fonts, and other physical appearance.
Someone has to do the programming for the project to move forward. But with the person who actually does something comes responsibility. To simplify the work in this project, it is a game of how to be on the side that imposes the responsibility. If you think of it as such a game, it is enjoyable to a certain extent, but it is not interesting enough to devote much of your life to.  
As the strongmen in this game rise to the top, they will have the power to control the rules, and even more BSJ will be nurtured. Those who fail to fulfill the responsibilities imposed on them will be devalued. On the other hand, fulfilling responsibilities is not valued as much as being able to do BSJ.<span class="footnote">
It is impossible to fulfill this responsibility in the first place. This is because the project was obtained by ignorant salespeople spreading lies. What could have been done normally became impossible because of the product that the sales person sold. Therefore, the responsibility here is to keep the project within the scope of what is realistically possible, to convince the client, and to make it work. Nevertheless, the project was featured on the product's website as a success story. This was because the customers of this project were causing social problems related to compliance, and this project had to be shown to have eliminated those problems.
</span>
If we give due regard to the ability to do what is necessary, they will face the fact that BSJ is the only thing they are capable of doing.
In order to protect their own position, they must continue to lie about the importance of BSJ.
At this time, they are not aware that they are lying.
They have lived his life diligently following the common-sense route presented by society and has demonstrated his excellence, but they think that this must not be a lie.
When the lie becomes too much for them, they may become aggressive.
This is because to force people to face a lie is to deny the life they have believed in.
To a lying society, the **real** is the enemy.

## suppression
As I stated at the beginning of this article, I consider the closing of the Cinematheque to be fascist suppression on the free market.
Of course, the police do not act as they did during World War II, and no one exists who believes they were complicit in the closing of the Cinematheque.
Economic violence is carried out by the "invisible hand".
The principle by which the invisible hand operates is neither good nor evil.
However, if the psychology of unjustified hostility by people controlled by lies is brought together, the invisible hand becomes a force that should be called suppression and damages the accumulated wisdom of humankind.  
For those who are subservient to a society of lies, truth and authenticity are difficult to face, and the attack on wisdom becomes more intense as the proportion of the group homogenized by subservience to the society of lies increases.
In today's society, where lies are so pervasive, the survival of the accumulation of wisdom is supported by the economically irrational activities of those who value it.
The Cinematheque was one of those cinemas that engaged in such activities and continued to show authentic films that are enemies to a society of lies.

A typical example of repression is the prohibition of telling truths that do not conform to the totalitarian direction.
In the next chapter, we will present examples of films shown at the Cinematheque that depict truths that disturb the peace of the lying society.
