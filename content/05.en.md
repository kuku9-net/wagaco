"The Secret of Kells" is an animated fantasy set in 9th century Ireland.
The film is created using real people and myths.
At that time, Ireland had its own Christian culture and arts that differed from those on the continent, and monasteries served as centers of scholarship, religion, and the arts.
The elaborate geometric patterns, such as spirals and concentric circles, are particularly distinctive.
This pattern has its roots in the indigenous beliefs of the pre-Christian era, when the boundary between nature and man was blurred.

The protagonist of the story is the boy who draws the Book of Kells.
The Book of Kells is an Irish national treasure and is currently housed in the Trinity College Library in Dublin.
Since printing technology was not available at that time, Bibles were copied by hand.
A manuscript is not just a written text, but the text and pictures are decorated with very detailed patterns.
The small, exquisite drawings that can only be seen under magnification, the production of various colors of ink, and the decoration with gold and other materials are artifacts that reflect the best of the technology of the time.
The Book of Kells has been called the most beautiful book in the world.
It is amazingly beautiful even to modern eyes, so it is no wonder that people of that time felt mystical power in it.  
The film is based on the Irish tradition, with a medieval view of art that makes extensive use of geometric patterns.
Such images, coupled with synchronized music and sound effects, create a film that is a direct adaptation of the aesthetics of the Book of Kells.

The protagonist, Brendan, has no parents and is raised by his uncle, Cellach, as his guardian.
Kerouach is the abbot of the monastery and a man with a strong sense of responsibility.
He anticipated an invasion from the Vikings, so he focused on building the fort anyway, even using artists as labor.
In this film, the fort is both a symbol of civilization and a separator between man and nature.
Kerouach is obsessed with keeping Brendan inside the fort and having him help build it, and forbids him from going into the dangerous forest and drawing the Book of Kells.

Of course Brendan went to the forest and challenged himself to be able to complete the Book of Kells.
Overlaid on the story of his growth, the film shows the path humanity has taken.
He becomes friends with Aisling, the forest fairy, and begins to play in nature.
His battle with Crom Cruach, the god of the pre-Christian indigenous religion, was also won by recognizing the power of civilization.
He then achieved independence from his uncle, who tried to bind him to the fort, and went on his way to complete the Book of Kells.

Along the way, the fort was attacked by Vikings.
The Book of Kells was believed to have the power to blind the eyes of evil, but when the Vikings actually saw its contents, nothing happened and the book was easily discarded.
In the end, neither the fort nor the Book of Kells could prevent the Viking invasion.
However, both Brendan and Cellach survived, and the story ends when Cellach was finally able to show the completed Book of Kells to the Vikings.

Historically, Ireland was frequently invaded by the Vikings from the 9th to 12th centuries, and after the Normans landed in 1169, the country came under progressive domination from the outside. Around the end of the 19th century, as modernization led to the rise of nation-states in Europe and the rise of nationalism, Gaelic (Irish) language and cultural revival movements began to emerge.
While it created excessive chauvinism and strife, culture played a major role as a link to national identity.
The Book of Kells remains a national treasure, and this film was made about it.

Director Tom Moore, who created the film, was influenced by Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata.<span class="footnote">

He also said that he drew on Gustav Klimt for his two-dimensional representation.
In addition to his Irish heritage, the film is connected to a number of different national cultures.

Klimt's flat expression and gold decoration are considered to be influenced by Japanese art.
With the end of Japan's isolation from the rest of the world with the fall of the Edo shogunate, Japanese art became known abroad, and a Japonism boom took place in Europe.
Klimt was also the first head of the Vienna Secession.
The secessionist movement was formed to separate itself from the existing authoritative and conservative art world and to promote the development of pure and free art, with the aim of active contact with other countries and a break with commercial agendas.
Contrary to this desire, many of Klimt's works, which are contrary to traditional German art, were confiscated by the Nazi invaders, and some of them were lost.

Culture has been formed in a complex historical tangle.
It has sometimes been subjected to mindless violence by unthinking groups, and the culture has been in danger of being lost.
Nevertheless, people have been empowered by their own culture in an oppressive environment, and the culture has been passed on to empower future generations.  
If you look only at the surface of modern society, you may think it is a mass of lies and garbage, but if you wipe away some of the dirt and dig deep, you will see the infinite wisdom of humankind.
Books are one of the tools to do this digging.
Unfortunately, the bookstores are filled with practical books to pander to a society of lies and fiction to reinforce belief in a society of lies.
Still, there are many bookstores that are willing to deliver "selfish" books, even at the cost of economic irrationality.
I encourage you to find such a store and visit it.

## Dynabook and Open Source Software

caption="Illustration used in Alan Kay's essay"

In 1972, Alan Kay presented the concept of the personal computer in an essay entitled "A Personal Computer for Children of All Ages".
At that time, computers were located in laboratories and large corporations, and were used for computing and data processing, not for personal ownership.
In his paper, Kay presented a picture of a child playing with a device similar to today's tablets in such an era.
This imaginary device is named "dynabook".
The name is a combination of the words "dynamic" and "book," which directly translates to "dynamic book".
The following is a description of what a dynabook is:

>  It may be something with the attention grabbing powers of TV, but controllable by the child rather than the networks. It can be like a piano: (a product of technology, yes), but one which can be a tool, a toy, a medium of expression, a source of unending pleasure and delight...and, as with most gadgets in unenlightened hands, a terrible drudge!!
<cite>from "A Personal Computer for Children of All Ages"</cite>

Notice that Kay focuses on "who is in control" here.
Is the computer a "source of pleasure" or a "source of pain" for people today?
Is it a "terrible drudge"?
Kay's "source of pleasure" can be said to correspond to Fromm's "positive freedom".
In short, the question of whether or not a computer is a "source of pleasure" can be rephrased as whether the computer user is in control of their own will or whether they are being controlled by someone else.

Today's computers are less likely to feel like the tools for exploring the kind of freedom that Kay presented.
In an age where everyone owns a smartphone and is constantly exposed to comparisons with others, the ability to efficiently stimulate self-expression and insecurity has resulted in people being constrained by ever more bloated demands for approval.
In addition, the vast information processing power of computers enables a global economy of mass consumption by replacing resources and labor with numbers.
The global economy provides a massive supply of cheap and convenient goods at the expense of imposing inequality on the weak.
In a society that enjoys such unified benefits, any attempt to deviate from this "selfish" business model means that one is forced to compete with cheap and convenient goods. In other words, "selfishness" is practically suppressed.
After all, our present way of life is bound to a lying rationality.  
Here, remember that so far humanity has been free from the bondage of nature and social institutions.
I believe that the next step is freedom from the lying desires created by society, which is the path that humanity should follow.
An environment should be created in which living a common sense, rational life style is naturally connected to the development of wisdom.
If we just leave everything to chance and remain passive, someone will not give us such a society.
We need to take control back into our hands.

Smalltalk, the Dynabook's operating system, leaves complete control to the user.
You can refer to the code of the operation being performed and even update the behavior by rewriting it.
The children in the essay open the source code of a space war game, rewrite the program, and experiment with the laws of physics in the computer.
The computers we use today are not moving toward a Dynabook-like dynamic.
In many cases they are being used according to the usage designed by companies.
In addition, many codes and data are owned by companies and are black boxes of details.  
On the other hand, a vast amount of source code is open to the public as a shared asset, and many engineers update it on a daily basis.
Making the source code visible to everyone with the aim of developing it together is called open source.<span class="footnote">
In the 1980s, a movement to maintain source code as common property began, led by Richard Stallman. The recent trend toward open source is not so much a continuation of the ideas of that time, but more because of its superiority as a development method. In other words, rather than monopolizing source code, it is more beneficial for a company to share it with many engineers to improve quality. In addition, as the use of cloud computing and the scope of AI expands, data, computing resources, and user enclosure are becoming more valuable, and the reasons for keeping source code private are weakening. It is important to recognize the current situation where the freedom to use technology can change depending on the convenience of the company.

## Payment Methods
Thank you for reading this book to the end.
I want to tell you something important: **This book is not free. Please pay for the value of what you read**.<span class="footnote">
I believe that if there is no monetary payment, it satisfies Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial, but I could be wrong.
</span>
However, as you will understand if you have read this far, we cannot expect the current totalitarian-controlled market to properly price this book, nor are we willing to be part of a fascist economy.
If I leave it to the current free market to act rationally, I will be affirming a violent exploitative structure, and I don't want to act irrationally against it because it is hard to do so.  
We need an economy on **this side** that is detached from **that side**, which is full of lies.
We need to create an economy on this side where activities on this side of the economy are not mixed with injustice, where there is a healthy connection to history and a promise to contribute to its development.
By connecting people who are irrationally scattered on the periphery in the economy on this side to the network on this side, it can also serve as a place of refuge for isolated people.

A gift economy is an economy that can be easily created by anyone.<span class="footnote">
I am not denying barter or a monetary economy, just recommending it because it is easy. If it is possible to create a monetary economy that is separate from the yen, that is attractive. In Japan, the law prohibits anything that functions similarly to money, so creating a safe money economy would require either a change in the law or the breaking up of the government.
</span>
Please make payment by any of the following methods

#### Method 1: hand over directly
Please give me something of value or service that is worthy of this book.
I don't want a formal gift, but rather a share of the excess in my life.
The less influence of the economy on the other side, the better, and if it is produced by you, the best.

#### Method 2: hand over indirectly
Find someone around you who looks like this side and give them <ins>something that person might need</ins>.
Then tell that person about this book, and they can find someone else and give <ins>the thing that next person might need</ins>.
If people keep doing that, maybe someday something will reach me.

#### Method 3: Spend your money in the right stores
Spend the money for something beyond economic rationale, like a cinematheque.
Not only small cinemas, but also live music venues, event spaces, independent bookstores, other private stores, local vegetable and craft producers, etc.

By the way, Cinematheque has closed, but will be revived in 2024 as "Nagoya Kinema Neu".
Since nothing has changed in the situation, we assume that the severe business situation will continue.
Those who want to resist the lying society are encouraged to go.

#### Method 4: Spread this book "ENTHUSIASTICALLY"
If you cannot afford to give something away, then please spread this book to others.
At this time, please do not just spread the URL to an unspecified number of people on social networking sites, etc., but set a goal for each person and put your thoughts firmly into it. Quality is more important than quantity.
