## Decadent art
Hitler suppressed art that went against Nazi values as decadent art. Even if there was no political agenda, art that was not traditional German art was considered decadent, and avant-garde art was prohibited. Stalin of the Soviet Union, too, regarded socialist realism as the only art form, and suppressed all other art forms. In Japan, avant-garde art was often accused of being anti-government and arrested<span class="footnote">

</span>, and the art world drifted in a regime supporting direction.

Totalitarianism and the propagandizing of art often go hand in hand.
More than the promotion of propaganda,
there is also an unusual aggression toward those who stray from it.
In 1937 in Munich, Hitler held the "Great German Art Exhibition", which was a collection of Nazi-approved art.
At the same time "Exhibition of Decadent Art," which was a blatant display of works that the Nazis did not approve of were hold to make it seem that such art was a waste of taxpayer money.
Hitler made a speech at the opening ceremony of the Great German Art Exhibition, and the emphasis of his speech was clearly an abuse of decadent art.

This contemptuous value was not only Hitler's personal view,
but one that he shared with a good number of his fellow citizens.
In fact, the Decadent Art Exhibition was more popular than the Great German Art Exhibition,
and the Decadent Art Exhibition was crowded with citizens who did not usually go to museums,
and the works were also filled with hatred.
How did Hitler and his followers create this persistent feeling of exclusion?

"**Escape from Freedom**," by **Erich Fromm** published in 1941, is known as a classic analysis of the psychology of citizens who are turning to Nazism and totalitarianism. Fromm argues that, although modernization has given people freedom, they are escaping from it.

In Fromm's view, the starting point is how mankind has achieved freedom throughout history.
With the discovery of fire, the development of tools, and the development of civilization, humans have gained control over food, clothing, and shelter, and have been able to live more freely.
This can be said to be an achievement of freedom from the constraints of nature.
As civilization progressed further,
freedom of choice of profession and religion, suffrage, and free markets were established,
and one after another, the things that had previously held people in bondage were removed.
As they approach the modern age, the contours of the individual are clearly emphasized, and individuals are able to choose various ways of life.

This expanded freedom requires the individual to face a powerful external world.
The greater the freedom, the greater the pressure of responsibility for one's own decisions.
In a free market, it is impossible to predict what will sell and how much will sell, creating uncertainty.
Competition between individuals, and the loss of solidarity, leads to loneliness.
A sense of powerlessness is created by one's own smallness in the face of a powerful society.
<ins>After all, even after gaining freedom, one may still end up submitting to something in an attempt to free oneself from anxiety and loneliness, rather than the other way around.</ins>
Fromm expressed this as "Escape from Freedom."
Freedom from natural and social institutional constraints is expressed in the metaphor of independence from parents.
Those who cannot become independent will seek subservience to parents with whom they can feel comfortable again.
However, the original reliable parent no longer exists for mankind, which has not let go of civilization,
and fabricate a snooty subservient destination.

The desire to escape from freedom and find comfort in subservience leads to totalitarianism.
The desire for subordination escalates to the point where excessive aggression against the designated enemy provides a sense of oneness with one's fellow man and a sense of security in the knowledge that one is strong.
Aggression toward decadent art can be explained in this way.
Even without aggression, some people may act like machines to cover up their feelings,
and others may behave like others to gain a sense of subordination.
In either case, the person is controlled by forces other than **their own initiative** and has lost their sense of self.

## Totalitarianism
Often totalitarianism and individualism are seen as opposite concepts.
In that sense, Fromm's claim to see a trend from individualization toward totalitarianism may seem contradictory.
On careful examination, however, totalitarianism cannot exist without the establishment of the individual.
The feudal societies of the Middle Ages did not have the freedoms we have today, but that does not make them totalitarian.
A society in which there are individuals and there should be freedom, but that freedom is oriented in one direction and nothing else is allowed, can be called totalitarianism.

The more disparate the individuals are, the easier it is for them to be uniformly united by the forces that make them subservient to the whole.
In this view, the more individualized we become, the more likely we are to be inclined toward totalization.
Isolated and dispersed forces become entangled with the forces of totalization.
<ins>A condition that can resist totalitarianism is one in which each person has their own orientation as individual freedom is exercised, that is **solidarity with unevenness**.</ins>  
Totalitarianism does not mean that society is simply uniform,
but rather that there are gradations from person to person.
The more people who share the same landscape, the same values, and are aligned in the same direction, the stronger the force of identification becomes.
In this situation, sameness brings group tranquility.
Especially aradicalized groups will overenthusiastically praise each other for belonging to it,
and will seek a greater sense of togetherness.
Thus, totalitarianism can be established through group pressure to agree without the existence of a coercive regime.
Fromm shows that authority is not only a concrete regime, but also an internalized authority such as duty or conscience, or an anonymous authority such as public opinion.

## Positive freedom
{{< figure

src="images/02/Escape_from_Freedom_description.jpg"
caption="Negative freedom (freedom from...) and positive freedom (freedom to...)"
>}}

While civilization can lead to escape from freedom,
Fromm is not criticizing civilization.
Fromm classifies freedom into two kinds.
The "<ins>freedom from</ins>" obtained through the civilization and social institutions described so far is called **negative freedom**.
The other is **positive freedom**, or "<ins>freedom to</ins>".
Positive freedom is self-actualization through voluntary activity,
the ability to live independently in the external world.
Fromm's argument is that by converting negative freedom into positive freedom, one can attain a stable, self-established life.

In 1966, the Beatles decided to stop performing live.
The Beatles decided to stop playing live in 1966, as they sensed the loud cheers drowned out their performances,
and they felt the emptiness of a live show where no one was listening.
They went into the studio and actively employed the techniques available in the studio,
resulting in the album "Revolver," which opened up a world of musical possibilities.
If all they do is satisfy their need for approval by being cajoled,
you are simply pandering to society and losing their self.
The pursuit of one's own musical needs is positive freedom and self-establishment.  
You may think that you cannot achieve the greatness of the Beatles,
but the important thing in this example is not the magnitude of your social achievements.
What is important is that the individual's way of life has **voluntary**, without being confused by social syncretism.

The reason for using the Beatles as an example is to illustrate that positive freedom is not the same as unrestrained selfishness.
Rather, it is so valuable that it involves a great deal of respect for others and our predecessors.
Human history has developed wisdom through the accumulation of such respect.  
"Homer Pepe" by NFT Art, introduced in the previous chapter, has no respect.
It is an existence detached from the accumulation of wisdom as well as one-sided deprivation.
It is only a symbol for blind faith by those who can only judge value by symbols.
The fact that Homer Pepe was sold at such a high price can be seen as an indication of how much the power of those who follow symbols without substance has grown.<span class="footnote">
There is also NFT art created by author Matt Fury to counter the trend of Pepe abuse,
They, too, have sold for tens of millions of dollars.
I can't say that this one is detached from history,
I think it is valued as a symbol of opposition to the far right.
The problem here is a market that values only symbols divorced from substance, and the people who support such a market.
It is not possible to speak simply about the current market,
The film "The Price of Art" (2018, USA) is a good reference for questioning the state of the art market.
Of course, it was also screened at Cinematheque.</span>

> The growth of the basis of the self is blocked and a pseudo self is superimposed upon this self,
which is-as we have essentially the incorporation of extraneous patterns of thinking and feeling.
Organic growth is possible only under the condition of supreme respect for the peculiarity of the self of other persons as well as of our own self.
This respect for and cultivation of the uniqueness of the self is the most valuable achievement of human culture
and it is this very achievement that is in danger today.
<cite>"Escape from Freedom" Chapter 7 Freedome and Democracy</cite>

The current void of value standards is what Fromm feared at the time of the 1941 publication.
Often the inability to afford equal freedom due to disparities is cited as a social problem.
That is, of course, a problem that must be corrected.
<ins>But it is also a serious problem to be aware of the damage to culture and wisdom caused by a mindless existence that is disconnected from history</ins>.

The 2021 attack on Congress by far-right white supremacists in the U.S. is emblematic as a manifestation of the disconnect between a mindless worldview and reality.
More than 1,000 people who believed the presidential election was rigged participated in the attacks,
and as of September 2023, more than 400 arrests had been made. These arrests<span class="footnote">
[Criminal proceedings in the January 6 United States Capitol attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_proceedings_in_the_January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack)
</span> include corporate CEOs, whose apologies have been reported in the news. According to an analysis of arrests by a University of Chicago research team as of May 2021<span class="footnote">

</span>, 17% were business owners and 30% were white-collar workers, in other words, moderately wealthy people.  
The white supremacist has lost their self.
Anxious about having no axis to stand on,
they bury themselves in the label "white"
and try to think they are relatively superior
by attacking the symbols they have defined as derogatory.
A being that has lost respect for others and is disconnected from history is in a state of flux and limbo,
easily swept along in whatever direction is convenient.
There are many problems in the world that can be solved with money,
but even if one has money and can afford the freedom of passivity to the fullest,
the anxiety of those who have lost their self is unbearable,
and they are desperate to be subservient to a **Lying society**.

## Words and Lies
{{< figure

In the manga "Pippi the Prophetess" by Chuya Chikazawa, there is a chimpanzee named Elizabeth who suddenly becomes able to speak. Elizabeth, who describes herself as having only the intelligence of an ape, has this to say about language.

> The more I try to explain with words, the more something is different. I don't like words very much after all.  
I hate words because as soon as they leave my mouth, they leave my heart and become lies on their own.  
There is no name for evil. If there is, it's a liar! Or a fraud!
<cite>"Pipi the Prophetess" Vol. 2</cite>

In the story "PETRA GENITALIX" in the manga "The Witch" written by Daisuke Igarashi, there is the following line.

> You have to have the same amount of "experiences" and "words" to balance your mind.  
> If someone who has never seen the sky says, "The clear sky is blue," he is lying, even if he is not wrong.
<cite>"The Witch" PETRA GENITALIX</cite>

Imagine a world when there was no language yet. When you wanted to tell someone `something`, you would have tried to convey that `something` in your own way, such as "aah" or "oh" in addition to gestures.
The recipient of the expression also compares the situation with the expression and imagines `something` that the expression indicates.
Through repetition, the person who received the expression will feel that they understand what the expression means, and the person who expressed it will also feel that something is being conveyed to the recipient.
Established expressions remain after the death of the person who created them and are passed on to peers and offspring.
Expressions become increasingly complex, but babies learn how to express themselves at an astonishing rate, and both children and adults expand their new expressions with **voluntary**.
The expansion of expression also expands the perception of the world as seen by the individual.
Expression takes the form of writing, drawing, and music, which become art and learning, and shared conventions and discipline, which build society.
All of these expressions are the wisdom of humankind.  
As language becomes more complex and more elaborate, and society becomes structured on words, too much is structured on words, and words and the `something` to which they refer often diverge.
In the beginning, there was `something` and there were only words that vaguely expressed it, but when people feel like they can express anything with words, they tend to neglect the existence of `something`.
Even the words you said, in reality you were just bringing someone else's words, and if you think about it, the `something` to which the words refer may be completely different.
Sometimes you do not realize that words that are socially commonly used are not properly connected to `something` in the individual and are left in the air.
It is human nature to not face the `something` you don't want to see in ourselves and to cling desperately to it by making up words to disguise it.
This divergence or absence is what I call a **lie**.
The strong conviction of the existence of `something` is the establishment of the self, while the loss of `something` and the ability to speak only lies is the loss of the self.

We can think of the whole of human wisdom as a single living organism.
Each of our consciousnesses is a cell of that organism, and it grows by strengthening the connections between cells through communication via various media.
If reading this text now is stimulating your brain, it is also stirring the life form of wisdom.
There is a vast `something` in this life form that has been created throughout the history of mankind up until now<span class="footnote">The ideas in this section are inspired by the discussion of language acquisition centered on Michael Tomasello and others, and are discussed in Morten H. Christiansen and Nick Chater's "The Language Game: How Improvisation Created Language and Changed the World" by Morten H. Christiansen and Nick Chater, which includes a section titled "The Life of Language"</span>.  
Those who damage culture at the end of a totalitarian homogenization dominated by false values divorced from history should be called tumors to wisdom.
So far, I have given examples that stand out for their clarity, such as those who see value in symbols like Homer Pepe and those who cannot accept Trump's failure to win the election.
But now that the tumor is so widespread in society, wisdom seems to have taken a terrible turn for the worse.  
In the next chapter, I will explain how widespread this tumor is, and therefore how totalitarian our society has become.
