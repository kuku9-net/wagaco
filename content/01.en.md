Nagoya Cinematheque (referred to as Cinematheque{{< span footnote>}}
There is "Cinematheque Takasaki" in Gunma Prefecture, and there are several other cinemas with the name "Cinematheque" throughout the world. The abbreviation "Cinematheque" here should be taken as a term of endearment by the locals.
{{< /span >}}) closed in July 2023.

It was a small cinema with 40 seats and only one screen.
For over 40 years, many film professionals and movie fans love it
because the theater continued to screen selected films.
The sad voices that abound around me often include a sense of resignation that "this is the way of the times."
But I am rather indignant at the flaws in our social system.
Fascism has formed on top of the current free market, I see in the current society the same structure as that of the Nazis, who suppressed decadent art. I would like to argue in this book that we should recognize and resist this oppression.

## The cause is not the coronavirus pandemic
The Cinematheque website explains the circumstances leading up to the closing.

>  ■We had already reached the danger zone in March 2020.  
We considered closing the theater at this stage, but the popularity of "Mini Theatre Aid" and "Cinematheque Aid," which was established by volunteers, helped us to gather support.
In addition, support measures from the government and administration have also been added, and we have been able to hold on for a few years.
We decided that it was time to quit when our reserves disappeared.
Since last year, the government and administrative support has been cut off, and our deficit will increase significantly.  
■Currently, we are running a weekly deficit of around 180,000 yen.  
If we continue at this rate, we will reach the breaking point in July. On an annual basis, this is a loss of around 9 million yen. We hope that you will understand the bitterness of our decision to close.

The situation is explained with even specific figures.
The request to refrain from the coronavirus pandemic has certainly done a lot of damage to the film industry's revenues, though,
However, the message can be read as not wanting the cause of the closures to be trivialized to coronavirus pandemic.
Let's review the situation of the film industry based on the data.

According to data from the Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan, Inc,
Box-office revenues for films since 2000 have generally remained flat, with repeated increases and decreases,
The decline in 2020, when the COVID-19 began, is notable.
However, looking at the period before COVID-19, there has been an upward trend since around 2013, with 2019 being the highest year on record.
It seems that even when the industry was at its most exciting, Cinematheque's business was not doing well.  
The Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan also compiles trends in the total number of screens in all cinemas.
The number of screens as a whole is on an upward trend, but it seems to be increasing due to the increase in the number of screens owned by cinema complexes.
The number of screens in the rest of the cinemas is rather decreasing.
The number of screens decreased almost monotonically until around 2015 and seems to have continued to decline slightly since then.

Next, we plotted the distribution of box-office revenue by release date based on the Kogyo Tsushinsha's top 100 box-office grosses of all time.
The highest grossing film of all time at over 40 billion yen was "Blade of Oni no Ruin" Infinity Train Arc," which was released in October 2020.
In addition to "Demon Slayer", there have been intermittent hits during COVID-19.
The gap between hits and others seems to be widening.

## Book "From a Small Cinema"
Yuji Hirano, who served as Cinematheque manager, passed away in January 2019.
Mr. Hirano was the one who continued to staff the Cinematheque from its predecessor, "Nagoya Cineast".
A collection of writings contributed by Mr. Hirano has been published as a book titled "From a Small Movie Theater."
In this book, he introduces the films shown, his thoughts on films, and the predicament of movie theaters.

Mr. Hirano looks at film as a whole from an egalitarian perspective.
For example, he talks about George Lucas' exploration of the latest technology and welcomes the era in which people can easily watch beautiful quality films on their cell phones.
He also talks about his hopes for the expansion of film possibilities as the times change from film to digital, but also exposes the managerial predicament that this will benefit the cinema complexes to a great extent, while placing a heavy burden on the mini-theaters.

> In essence, the film industries, with Hollywood at its apex, are telling to us, "Please feel free to take this opportunity to withdraw from the market." So, what do we do?
<cite>"From a Small Cinema" Is digitization a revolution in film?</cite>

> We are like weeds on the edge of the great road called "film", and we are painfully aware that our fate depends on the fine car in the middle of the road. Sometimes the water thrown from the car window helps, sometimes we get run over and disappear without a trace...
<cite>"From a Small Cinema" Is digitization a revolution in film?</cite>

Human history has always been built on various beginnings and endings.
If we follow the market principle, the fact that the cinematheque cannot continue its operation means that consumers have judged that its role has ended.
However the role of the cinematheque is not over. The Cinematheque has tried to be a place for new culture, and indeed it has been such a place.
Commenting on the box office success of Hiroshi Teshigawara's "Antony Gowdy," which broke out of its early cinematheque woes, he said.

> It is said that it is important to stay half a step ahead of the audience's desires at the box office,
and I think this film was a hit that fit that principle.
However, if you will forgive my impertinence,
I would like to be five or ten steps ahead of the audience in spirit.
Even if we cannot expect a hit like "Gaudi,"
we would like to continue to present to the audience
what we think is interesting, regardless of public opinion.

Hirano-san continued to struggle with the managerial balance, but he still had something he wanted to show to the audience that transcended profit and loss.

One of the reasons for the closure of the Cinematheque may be the change in the way people view movies.
Movies are now distributed over the Internet and can be easily viewed at home or on the move from a smartphone.
The vast amount of data that has been accumulated makes it possible to propose movies that are optimized to users' tastes and provide them with a high level of satisfaction.
On the production side, the level of difficulty in shooting, editing, and releasing films has decreased, and a vast number of films are being created one after another.
In the future, new films or expressions that go beyond film will continue to be created in response to such an environment.  
When it comes to such a world, the role of the cinematheque is even higher.
Cinematheque is more than a place to consume movies for entertainment,
it is a place to train the viewer's eye to see the world with a higher resolution.
Many of the films screened at the Cinematheque do not approach the audience,
the audience is often required to actively watch and think for themselves.
The Cinematheque screened films that were bursting out of the mainstream, such as films that told the perspectives of various minorities from different countries{{< span footnote >}}
"The Battle of Algiers" depicts Algeria's resistance to colonial rule in the 1950s and 1960s,
"Toto and His Sisters," in which children live alone in a Romanian slum,
"Bangkok Nights," which tells the story of a prostitute in Thailand and the connection between war and Japan.{{< /span >}} and films with unusually long running times.{{< span footnote >}}
"Sátántangó" with a running time of 7 hours and 18 minutes,
"Tie Xi Qu: West of the Tracks" with a running time of 9 hours and 11 minutes, etc.{{< /span >}}

The Cinematheque also provided a place for growth for the production side.
At the end of the year, they held an independent film festival which were selected freer expression than usual. During the festival, after the program was screened, there was a "Bring Anything!" This program has led to the emergence of future filmmakers.

## The restrooms of the Cinematheque
{{< figure

This picture is a sticker that was placed in the restroom of the Cinematheque.
The frog is a character named **Pepe** in the movie "*Feels Good Man*".

Pepe is the epitome of the apathetic young man,
who is depicted as just lounging around with his friends.
In the comics, Pepe is depicted as just lounging around with his friends,
taking a piss and saying "feels good man?"
This became a popular internet meme and was used on 4chan and various other internet sites.
The character continued to grow on its own and became a hate symbol for the alternative right wing in the United States.

Regardless of the author's intentions, Pepe's existence has come to have racist connotations. The author, Matt Furey, tried to stop this trend on the Internet, but was unable to do anything about it and decided to have Pepe die in the story.

The film features an NFT (non-fungible token) trader named Peter Kell.
He is a successful trader of Pepe's NFTs.
The timing of Pepe's spread as a net meme coincided with the rise of NFTs, which caused prices to skyrocket for the rarer, early NFT pieces.
In the film, he boasted that **Homer Pepe**,
a combination of Pepe and Homer from The Simpsons,
was particularly rare.  
After the film's release he sold Homer Pepe. It was a cryptocurrency worth about $300,000 in 2021 dollars at the highest NFT transaction value at the time.

</span>
<ins>This means that Homer Pepe is considered by the market to be worth enough to cover Cinematheque's losses for several years.</ins>
A market that values Homer Pepe as expensive,
when it is just a pie in the sky and can be held vacantly on the Internet,
is disconnected from its real value.
The free market does not allow a culture-building entity like the Cinematheque to exist,
while it allows a culture-extracting entity like Homer Pepe to exist.

Some people may think that what is left is the best after the unnecessary is weeded out in the competition.
This means that the films shown at the Cinematheque were "selfish" films for some people,
and that today's society does not allow such "selfishness".
This is the idea that the current society has internalized.  
In this book, I would like to clarify the following points. The first is what society did not allow, that is, what was the "selfishness" of the cinematheque. The second is to explain why society did not allow it by comparing it to the situation under the fascist regime.

This document will refer to several films,
and will describe them in detail and will include spoilers.
There are many aspects that inevitably cannot be conveyed in writing.
They are all strong films that do not lose their appeal,
even if they are spoiled.
Please go see them if you have the chance.<span class="footnote">Of course, these films were screened at the Cinematheque.</span>
